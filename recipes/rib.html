    <p>Chef John's pepper Parm prime rib is rich, savory, and roasted to medium-rare perfection—an elegant way to prepare this premium cut of beef.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 pound) bone-in prime rib of beef, fat cap trimmed</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt (about 1 teaspoon per pound of meat)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons very soft butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>2 rounded tablespoons coarse ground black pepper, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Optional step: Use a sharp knife to cut down 1/8 inch through the tough membrane on top, every inch or so, to prevent the tough membrane from contracting and distorting the shape of the meat as it roasts.</li>
        <li>Salt beef all over and transfer to a rack placed over a roasting pan. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 8 to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 2 hours before roasting.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Stir butter, cheese, and black pepper together in a bowl. This mixture needs to be very soft to spread evenly over the meat.</li>
        <li>Blot any moisture on the surface of beef with a paper towel. Apply a few teaspoons of butter mixture to bottom and sides of beef, then spread remaining mixture across the top. Apply more black pepper and Parmigiano Reggiano to the top if desired.</li>
        <li>Pour beef broth and water into the bottom of the roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Roast in the upper center of the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue to roast until the internal temp in the center of the thickest part reaches 120 degrees F (49 degrees C) for medium rare. Roasting may take a total of about 1 1/2 hours, but always use an instant read thermometer or meat thermometer to determine doneness rather than using a timer, as time will vary greatly depending on the size of the roast.</li>
    </ol>
